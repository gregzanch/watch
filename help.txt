watch is a program to monitor changes in the file system, and run a command upon changes.
To use watch, pass in a list of files (seperated by a newline) to stdin.

Usage:
  <files> | watch "<command>"
  <files> | watch [-p|--poll-rate <poll_time_in_ms>] "<command>"
  watch -h|--help

Examples:

The following will watch all files in the `src` directory, and run `cargo build` when a file changes.

  find src/* | watch "cargo build"

The following will watch all files in the `src` directory every `1000` milliseconds, and run `cargo build` when a file change is detected.

  find src/* | watch --poll-rate 1000 "cargo build"

The following will print the help text

  watch --help
