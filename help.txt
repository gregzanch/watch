watch is a program to monitor changes in the file system, and run a command upon changes.
To use watch, pass in a list of files (seperated by a newline) to stdin.

Usage:
  <files> | watch "<command>"
  <files> | watch [-p <poll_time_in_ms>] "<command>"

Example:
  find src/* | watch "cargo build"
  find src/* | watch -p 100 "cargo build"
